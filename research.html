	<h1>Research Statement</h1>
	</p>
	
	<div class="rounded">
	<p>
	Computer modeling & simulation has emerged as an indespensable method 
	for scientific research of materials in parallel to experiment and theory. 
	In general, I am interested in computational simulation 
	of materials with microstructure.
	To study this field, one should have not only in-depth knowledge 
	on physics of a material, but also 
	strong background in computational science (numerical analysis)
	and relevant mathematics with regards to partial differential equations,
	which are all my broad interest.

	<p> Polyscrystalline materials are composed of many tiny sigle crystal pieces
	(known as grains) stuck together. It is common microstructure for metals
	and ceramics. The growth of grain boundaries are of interest because important 
	physical properties (e.g., yield strength, conductivity, etc.) 
	of polycrystalline material depend on the grain boundaries, 
	arising industrial process such as heat treatment (annealing). 
	If one can model and simulate the growth of grainboundaries accurately, 
	polycrystalline materials can be tuned to achieve a variety of uses.

	<p> 
	I use machine-learning techniques to solve an elliptic partial differential equation, which
	typically arises for modeling creeping non-Newtonian fluid flows. 
	In mechanics of non-Newtonian fluid, (often called as computaitonal rheology)
	the complicated rheological behavior of fluids 
	induces	strong non-linearities of the governing equation. 
	Resolving exponential solution profile with a conventional numerical method still remains a challening task.  
	Instead, I take a turn to neural network approach for solving such systems. 
	Rheolgical model provides a vast amount of prior knowledge that may have not been
	fully exploited. To make the best use of it, physically informed neural network (PINN) transforms  
	clascial mechanic problem into typical minimization problems and train deep neural network 
	to solve supervised learning tasks. 
	This process respects the physics described by constitutive equation of Non-Newtonian models.   
	While the PINN framework is yet premature compared to classcial numerical methods, 
	its potential capability to predict the strong non-linear behavior of a material deserves intensive future research in this field.

	<h1>Complex fluid flow simulation</h1>
	</p>
	<div class="rounded">
	<p>I use Finite-element method to simulate non-Newtonian fluid flows.
	I consider fluid mechanics of rheologically complex fluids
	with yield stress, viscoelasticity, and thixotropy. 
	While there exist a variety of rheological models to describe
	these nonlinear fluid-mechanics, 
	parameters of the models are usually fit against data acquired from simplest geometry. 
	Therefore, the uses of rheological models for real material process stage, 
	which often include involved flow geometry, are inherently extrapolative. 
	I consider the uncertainty quantificaiton of such cases and 
	investigate the sensitivity of model parameters in simulation predictions.
