	<h1>Motion of grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials</h1>
	</p>
	
	<p> Polyscrystalline materials are composed of many tiny sigle crystal pieces
		(known as grains) stuck together. It is common microstructure for metals
		and ceramics. The growth of grain boundaries are of interest because important 
		physical properties (e.g., yield strength, conductivity, etc.) 
		of polycrystalline material depend on the grain boundaries, 
		arising industrial process such as heat treatment (annealing). 
		If one can model and simulate the growth of grainboundaries accurately, 
		polycrystalline materials can be tuned to achieve a variety of uses.

	<h1>Complex fluid flow simulation</h1>
	</p>
	<p>I use Finite-element method to simulate non-Newtonian fluid flows.
	I consider fluid mechanics of rheologically complex fluids
	with yield stress, viscoelasticity, and thixotropy. 
	While there exist a variety of rheological models to describe these nonlinear fluid-mechanics, 
	parameters of the models are usually fit against data acquired from simplest geometry. 
	Therefore, the uses of rheological models for real material process stage, 
	which often include involved flow geometry, are inherently extrapolative. 
	I consider the uncertainty quantificaiton of such cases and 
	investigate the sensitivity of model parameters in simulation predictions.
