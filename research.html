	<h1>Research Statement</h1>
	</p>
	
	<div class="rounded">
	<p>
	Computer modeling & simulation has emerged as an indespensable method 
	for scientific research of materials in parallel to experiment and theory. 
	In general, I am interested in computational simulation 
	of materials with microstructure.
	To study this field, one should have not only in-depth knowledge 
	on physics of a material, but also 
	strong background in computational science (numerical analysis)
	and relevant mathematics with regards to partial differential equations,
	which are all my broad interest.

	<h1>Motion of grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials</h1>
	</p>
	
	<div class="rounded">
	<p> Polyscrystalline materials are composed of many tiny sigle crystal pieces
	(known as grains) stuck together. It is common microstructure for metals
	and ceramics. The growth of grain boundaries are of interest because important 
	physical properties (e.g., yield strength, conductivity, etc.) 
	of polycrystalline material depend on the grain boundaries, 
	arising industrial process such as heat treatment (annealing). 
	If one can model and simulate the growth of grainboundaries accurately, 
	polycrystalline materials can be tuned to achieve a variety of uses.

	<h1>Complex fluid flow simulation</h1>
	</p>
	<div class="rounded">
	<p>I use Finite-element method to simulate non-Newtonian fluid flows.
	I consider fluid mechanics of rheologically complex fluids
	with yield stress, viscoelasticity, and thixotropy. 
	While there exist a variety of rheological models to describe
	these nonlinear fluid-mechanics, 
	parameters of the models are usually fit against data acquired from simplest geometry. 
	Therefore, the uses of rheological models for real material process stage, 
	which often include involved flow geometry, are inherently extrapolative. 
	I consider the uncertainty quantificaiton of such cases and 
	investigate the sensitivity of model parameters in simulation predictions.
