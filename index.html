	<p>
	Hi there, Thanks for visiting my website. 
	I am an applied mechanist with research interests in scientific computing, numerical analysis, and mathematical
	modeling with applications to problems from Material Science and Non-Newtonian Fluid Dyanmics.  
	I am currently working in Admal's research group. 
	More information on me can be found here...
