	<p> I was grown up in Daejeon, Korea.
	After obtaining my undergraduate degree from the Seoul National University, 
	and a Masterâ€™s degree from UIUC, I joined Admal research group in Spring 2019. 
	My current interests lie in mathematical modeling of fully anisotropic grain boundary motion, 
	and developing fast and efficient algorithms to simulate polycrystalline materials in 3D.
