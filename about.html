	<h1>This is about page </h1>
	<p>Let me introduce myself to you <em>Hahahaha</em> Hahahaha. 
	I am a PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics 
	program at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. 
	After obtaining my undergraduate degree from the Seoul National University, 
	and a Master’s degree from UIUC, I joined Admal research group in Spring 2019. 
	My interests lie in mathematical modeling of fully anisotropic grain boundary motion, 
	and developing fast and efficient algorithms to simulate polycrystalline materials in 3D.
